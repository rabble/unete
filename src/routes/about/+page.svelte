        All of Us is designed to help people get more directly involved in
        progressive and left efforts throughout the U.S. confronting the MAGA
        program. The tool we offer can connect you with groups working on many
        issues as part of a larger social change movement aimed at building
        toward a better future for everyone.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Do We Do?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        We provide a directory designed to help people and organizations find
        each other. Organizations describe their work and what need they have
        for volunteers and new members. Individuals then search the directory to
        find an organization that they want to connect with, filtering for:

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Broadly speaking, The All of Us member groups are grassroots-friendly,
        progressive-leaning, non-commercial, and non-sectarian; they seek and
        give solidarity; they are welcoming and value participation. They are
        eager to reply to requests from people who want to join or to help them,
        and they are able to welcome and involve people who would fit well.
